
1.When sending a test email, based on the Figma design, it can be inferred that the expected behavior is to immediately receive a result
 indicating success or failure. 
 However, if the email is sent through MS365, we cannot know the result right away because it requires processing time. 
 So, what is the actual expected flow for this feature?
 -> define help what is success or failure ?
2.And if we send a test email, will it be added to the queue tab?
-> oke 
3.Suggest Create Template from DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS -> DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM
-> because not send exactly specific hours and minutes and second
